# CryptocurrencyFundamentalAnalysis
A tool, written in Python, to assist in the fundamental analysis of Cryptocurrencies

This is a fundamental analysis research tool for Cryptocurrencies, which assisted in investment decisions. It was built entirely in Python, making use of unstructured data from Reddit's major Cryptocurrency oriented subreddits, using Reddit's APIs. The tool allowed the end-user to discover the Cryptocurrency projects with the most fundamental support, by assessing the associated sentiment towards Cryptocurrency projects (using the VADER machine learning model) of users that were deemed to have understood the Technologies being discussed. This was doneby assigning each active Reddit user a score based on their Research tendencies.

It parses comments and posts by users for discussion of Cryptocurenncies, and then goes on to summarise the sentiment towards those Crypocurrencies mentioned, weighted for the user's knowledge and research depth.
